## var declarations

var---- can be changed.

let---- declarations cant be change

const------ cant be change

## var re-assigned

var----can happen

let---- can be done

const----cannot be done

```javascript
const marks = [35, 45, 75];
marks[1] = 78;
console.log(marks);
```

but in case of array if one index is changed then it gets changed because of the address in which it is stored differently.
so hence we can change values inside at the particular address.
