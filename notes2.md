 ## what is git??(maintain the versionf of app/project)

>It is a version control system.  
it stands for global information tracker     
backing up the source code  
we have branches,for version1,...etc  
commit is for save points(damn sure that code will work at particular time) (eg:10 commits= 1version) 
wen ever we are commiting make sure that code is working.  
it is able to maintain diff version of projects.
